    "If you have any questions please contact Kyle Proctor (proctork@oregonstate.edu)\n",
    "\n",
    "This code was used to conduct a systematic review to identify publishing trends related to the FEW nexus. The review looked at how the quantity of FEW nexus studies has changed over the years, where those studies were coming from, and which journals they were being published. \n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis was conducted using the Pyscopus plugin for python (http://zhiyzuo.github.io/python-scopus/). Pyscopus is a wrapper for the scopus API; the world’s largest database of peer reviewed literature. \n",
    "\n",
    "## use of this code requires a scopus API KEY \n",
    "scopus API keys can be obtained at this link (https://dev.elsevier.com/) a variable named key must then be created which is the value of this scopus key enclosed in single quotation marks\n",
    "for example : key = ' yourscoupuskeyhere'\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis here will produce all papers which matches the corresponding keywords and was produced in 2011 or later. The Analysis used in the journal article was conducted at the end of July and thus shows all papers produced before August 1st 2019\n",
    "The major work here is done by the pyscopus software which returns a dataframe with all of the papers, the remainder of the code is data manipulation for visualization"
